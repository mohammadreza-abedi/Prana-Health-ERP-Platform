🎯 UI/UX STRATEGIC CANVAS – ADVANCED PLATFORM LAYOUT v2.0

🧭 1. DESIGN INTENTION – هدف کلان طراحی
Design is a cognitive architecture. The UI must serve as a visual operating system for decision-making, not just an interface. Prioritize systems thinking over surface-level design.

• Shift from data-display to data-activation
• Interface should guide behavior, not just show options
• Design for trust, control, and cognitive clarity


📐 2. LAYOUT ARCHITECTURE – معماری چیدمان
Architect every region of the screen based on semantic role and user intention. Avoid symmetrical grid rigidity in favor of functional zones.

• Employ 12-column adaptive grid with contextual reflow
• Vertical rhythm must be governed by baseline grid alignment
• Introduce layout tokens: zone-density, priority-weight, flow-order


🌀 3. BEHAVIORAL LAYERING – لایه‌گذاری تعاملی
UI should breathe with the user. Define behavioral strata where interaction depth correlates with task complexity.

• Layer 1 – Passive UI (background, info-only)
• Layer 2 – Actionable UI (clickable modules, filters, inputs)
• Layer 3 – Modal UI (critical path overlays, confirmation flows)
• No visual element without a defined interaction pattern


📱 4. RESPONSIVE SEMANTICS – واکنش‌گرایی معنایی
Move from device-based responsiveness to role-context awareness. Screens should morph based on tasks, time, and user journey stage.

• Design breakpoints for use-case shifts, not just width
• Introduce adaptive components: self-scaling, collapsible, summarizing
• Prioritize critical path per device-role matrix


⚙️ 5. VISUAL HARMONY FRAMEWORK – هماهنگی بصری سیستماتیک
Unify all UI through visual semantics: meaning before styling. Use color, scale, spacing, and movement with intentional consistency.

• Color must encode: status, state, priority
• Scale with purpose: typography based on hierarchy and scan pattern
• Motion: subtle, directive, informative (not decorative)


🔁 6. PREDICTIVE UX BEHAVIOR – رفتار پیش‌بینی‌پذیر
Craft an anticipatory experience where users are never lost. Every element should signal consequence and affordance.

• Highlight expected interactions before they happen
• Support exploration through inline micro-guidance
• Implement visual memory cues (location-based state retention)


📊 7. DATA-FIRST NARRATIVE DESIGN – طراحی روایی داده‌محور
Dashboard must read like a story: what happened, what it means, what to do. Visual hierarchy should support analytical reasoning.

• Metrics grouped by intent: insight → comparison → action
• Cards act as micro-narratives: data, context, reaction
• Connect narrative arcs via layout (e.g., anomaly → drilldown → action button)


🔐 8. ROLE-BASED UI LOGIC – منطق رابط مبتنی بر نقش
Redesign UI structure dynamically per user role, maturity level, and access control.

• Declarative rendering per permission matrix
• Modular access zones for viewer, editor, admin, and super-admin
• User-mode toggling (e.g., Beginner ↔ Expert)


♻️ 9. MODULAR & EVOLVABLE DESIGN SYSTEM – سیستم طراحی پیش‌رونده
Every UI unit must be reusable, versioned, testable, and decoupled from global dependencies.

• Full implementation of atomic structure (Atomic → Molecular → Composite)
• Centralized style tokens and behavior logic
• Layouts rendered via schema-driven architecture (JSON + UI engine)


🧠 10. PERCEPTION-DRIVEN INFORMATION DESIGN – طراحی اطلاعاتی ادراکی
Structure information flow based on visual attention, memory retention, and task urgency.

• Zone-based layout: F-pattern, Z-pattern optimized for screen reading
• Dynamic reordering of UI based on task priority (AI-driven personalization)
• Use visual weight mapping: proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast


✅ ULTIMATE OUTCOME:
A perceptive, adaptive, and narratively intelligent layout system that delivers clarity at scale and evolves alongside the platform.

Design the UI as a **thinking environment**—not a container. Architecture is behavior.
