🎯 UI/UX STRATEGIC CANVAS – ADVANCED PLATFORM LAYOUT

🧭 1. DESIGN INTENTION – هدف کلان طراحی
Create a structured, interactive, and semantic layout where user journeys are prioritized over static visuals. The UI should communicate purpose and priority—not just placement.

• From "interface" to "insight"
• From "layout" to "narrative structure"
• From "component-based" to "context-driven"

📐 2. LAYOUT ARCHITECTURE – معماری چیدمان
Design is not about where components live—but what they do. Use grid theory as a scaffold for behavioral hierarchy.

• Primary layout: Grid 12-columns with modular sub-grids
• Sections organized as: overview → detail → interaction
• Fluid containers; avoid fixed width unless contextually required

🌀 3. BEHAVIORAL LAYERING – لایه‌گذاری تعاملی
Move away from z-index wars and absolute positioning. Instead, prioritize logical stacking, adaptive flow, and contextual visibility.

• Use sticky + contextual containers, not fixed overlays
• Define elevation roles (z-10: background / z-20: interaction / z-30: modal)
• Remove scroll-nesting patterns. Use progressive reveal instead

📱 4. RESPONSIVE SEMANTICS – واکنش‌گرایی معنایی
Responsive design should adapt content logic, not just width. Every layout should semantically restructure across breakpoints.

• Mobile: prioritize narrative, CTA-first, hide visual clutter
• Tablet: transform grids to step-based display
• Desktop: provide spatial hierarchy and parallel content

⚙️ 5. VISUAL HARMONY FRAMEWORK – هماهنگی بصری سیستماتیک
Use a consistent visual grammar to reduce cognitive friction.

• Typography scale aligned with 8pt grid
• Color used for function (state/status/context), not style
• Align all elements to visual baseline: vertical rhythm is sacred

🔁 6. PREDICTIVE UX BEHAVIOR – پیش‌فرض تعاملی
The UI should offer feedback before being asked. Anticipation over reaction.

• Use hover, active, and loading states strategically
• Provide micro-feedbacks (vibration, highlight, glow)
• Never leave user in uncertainty: show progress, even if it's empty

📊 7. DATA-FIRST NARRATIVE DESIGN – روایت داده‌محور
Transform data into meaning through layout. Information must speak hierarchy and relation.

• Each card: metric + delta + trend + suggestion
• Connect cards visually via context (not color only)
• Introduce causality: "what happened" > "why" > "now what"

🔐 8. ROLE-BASED UI LOGIC – رابط مبتنی بر نقش کاربر
Design flexible layers that adapt based on user role, need, and device.

• Hide, show, or reflow modules based on permissions
• Use onboarding journeys for new users
• Let power users reconfigure layouts

♻️ 9. MODULAR & EVOLVABLE DESIGN SYSTEM – سیستم ماژولار و توسعه‌پذیر
Every component should be a living entity—not a dead visual.

• Follow atomic design (Atoms → Molecules → Organisms)
• Isolate layout logic from visual logic
• Plug-and-play components: zero side effects on removal

🧠 10. PERCEPTION-DRIVEN INFORMATION DESIGN – طراحی درک‌محور
Design must reduce ambiguity and guide decision-making effortlessly.

• Prioritize clarity over style
• Present a visual answer to "What now?"
• Design content zones, not just UI blocks

✅ ULTIMATE OUTCOME:
A layout that grows with users, flexes with content, and never loses structural integrity—regardless of device, role, or time.

Design the logic, not just the looks. Structure is story.
